Cryptography idea
i am developing an algorithm to facilitate encryption 

this is as a part of the cryptography mini-project that i have to do....

the algorithm works on the basis of creating an encrypted string by applying XOR between the string and the Fibonacci sequence

for example)
abcdef should convert to [a XOR 0][b XOR 1][c XOR 1][d XOR 2][e XOR 3][f XOR 5] and so on...
